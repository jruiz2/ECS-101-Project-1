# ECS-101-Project-1

# Progress we have made as a group so far:

# We have created our compression table with the 
# entire alphabet(lower-case and upper-case) and 
# characters stated in instructions on a google 
# document, with their corresponding 5-bit short 
# and 6-bit long strings. We will be converting
# the google doc to PDF soon.

# We have created the encode using a single loop
# and a definition and have placed it 
# in its own pull request, so that we can edit it
# and finalize it later in the main branch.
# We will work on and finalize decode by this weekend.

# Questions for Dean Smith:
# Are 5-bit and 6-bit strings okay to use? Is it a 
# weird or too long of a combination?
# Is a long loop/if statement okay if it does the job?
# We appreciate any feedback on our code! Thank you so much! :)

# Response from Dean Smith: Great questions!
# Not weird to use 5- and 6-bit strings. I might actually do the same thing if I were you!
# Sure, no problem with a big if loop. This is more about creativity than coding
# Thanks for getting started and having some really cool ideas!
